# 1. Use A Logo
Design a logo that not only displays your creative style but also describes who you are as a designer. Keep in mind that your logo is usually where users’ eyes go when they first visit your site. You want to make a good impression from the get-go.

Though your logo will be one of the first things your visitors see, you do not have to make it over the top to display your unique style. It is perfectly fine to simply use your name in a decorative style. It is common practice to link your logo to your homepage, so users can return there whenever they want.

Here are some great examples of web designers who have created simple, yet effective logos.


Anthony Wiktor uses a simple but slick logo using just his initials. This logo works well with the website’s overall theme.


Ellen Skye Riley went a bit simpler with her logo design, but it is amazingly effective and intriguing.

# 2. Create An Original Tagline
There is nothing worse than a cliché tagline on a portfolio website. After all, the entire purpose of your website portfolio is to show off your creative side. Stay far away from cliché taglines, and create something that adequately displays your unique style.

Stay away from common phrases like “howdy,” “hi there,” and “welcome.” Instead, opt for a phrase that describes what you can do, and why you are better than your peers are.

Here are some great examples of taglines other web designers are using to draw attention to themselves.


Devon Stank does an outstanding job of using a tagline that is simple, yet gets right to the point of what he can do for you.


Jim Ramsden does a great job at keeping his tagline simple with just a few phrases that describe his overall style.


Filip Turner’s tagline is unique, to the point, and communicates what he can to do to help a potential client.

# 3. Clearly List Your Services
In most instances, visitors want to understand the types of services you offer quickly. Do not make them search your site to find out. Chances are you will lose them.

You will want to include the services you provide somewhere on your website portfolio in a prominent location such as the home page. In addition, you may consider adding a “services” tab or creating a separate page for each of the services that you offer. Adding a services tab should come secondary to the prominent position on your home page.

Here are some examples of great work.


84 Colors provides verbiage upfront on the types of services offered. That way, users do not have to spend time navigating the site trying to figure it out.


Vadim does a great job of explaining specializations. The website also includes some animation, further displaying the type of work you can expect.


Guided Creative displays their services on the home page, and also has a tab at the top labeled “services,” providing users with multiple ways to understand what the company specializes in.

# 4. Portfolio of Work: Include Only The Best
Including your actual work into your website portfolio is kind of a given, but you would be surprised by the number of people who include too much. Your website portfolio should display your best work. So, it should only include the best of the best.

As a designer, you are more than likely proud of all the work you have done, but it is important to take a step back and view your work from the eye of a potential employer or customer. Be objective, and even ask the opinion of some of your network connections, friends, and family. It is very tempting to include all your work, but doing so is a major mistake that could leave some of your best work unseen.

# 5. About Me Section
Your website visitors want to know about you. Your “About Me” section is the place where you can brag about yourself. It is essential to make yourself stand out from the crowd.

Be detailed yet concise in your “About Me” section. Visitors do not want to read an entire autobiography. Get to the point of your accomplishments and tell why they matter.

It doesn’t hurt to put a picture in this section to help humanize your profile. It used to be a picture is worth a thousand words, now it’s more a video is worth a thousand words. Highly consider adding a video introduction into your “About Me” section to help visitors get acquainted with you and your experience.

Here are some good examples of designers who have utilized the “About Me” section correctly.

# 6. Make Your Contact Info Prominent
If you take nothing else away from this article, make sure you remember this, make your contact information prominent and visible. This is where many designers fall short. It can be as simple as adding a contact form to your website or adding small icons in the header or footer of your website’s design.

It is also a good idea to include buttons for the various social media networking sites you are on, especially LinkedIn. Before you add social networking sites, make sure you do not have any inappropriate images, videos, or posts that could deter potential employers or clients from hiring you.

You may also want to add an additional tab specifically for contact information, that way all your bases are covered. Here are some examples of how other designers are displaying their contact information.

# 7. Include Your Resume
It seems almost like a no-brainer, but the number of website portfolios that do not include a resume would surprise you. In addition to displaying your work and having a detailed “About Me” section, a resume helps a potential employer understand your related work experience and educational background in much more detail.

Do not make it hard for them to find your resume, and make it easy to download to PDF and print. We will resort back to Anthony Wiktor for this example.


You can see how he makes it easy for a visitor to download his resume as a PDF as well as print it off for further examination. You want to do this too.

# 8. Create A Blog
A blog is a great way to show off your expertise within the industry. It can also help your website be found on the search engines if the content is SEO-optimized. Make sure to enable comments on your blog so you can interact with your readers.

Creating unique and engaging industry-related blog material will display your expertise within the field, which can further add to your credibility. If you are going to create a blog, make sure you add fresh content to it frequently. There is nothing more frustrating from a user perspective than navigating to a blog only to­­ see one or two posts from years back.

# 9. Don’t Just Go Simple: Be Bold
Simplicity can work for some industries, but within the web design field you want your site to reflect the type of work you are capable of. Your overall design does not have to be over-the-top but stray away from plain white backgrounds.

Show that you put some real effort into designing your site. This will communicate to potential employers and customers the type of work you can do. Your portfolio website will be used as a first impression to potential employers and customers; you should do everything you can to make a good lasting impression.

# 10. Use The Correct Communication Style
One of the main purposes of a website portfolio is to introduce yourself to others, so you do not want to sound overly robotic. Use a conversational tone that is business-professional, and aim not to ramble. After you have written all the text that will go on your website, read, and re-read to cut out the unnecessary fluff.

Remember, your website visitors want to know about you as quickly as they can. They do not want to be consumed with long pages of text that seem to have no end.

Think of yourself as a website viewer. What do you like to see in a site? How much text overwhelms you when you visit a site?

Additional Tips & Tricks to Make Your Website Portfolio Amazing
Communicate your location somewhere on your website. Your physical location may not be an issue to some of your potential employers and clients, but some prefer to work with professionals nearby.
Make sure your website’s code is valid. You want people to take you seriously, and the first step in validating your skills is to ensure all code on your site is functional.
Connect your LinkedIn profile to your website portfolio. This was mentioned briefly in a different section, but your LinkedIn profile can serve as a great resource to network with others within the web design industry. It is also a great way to show off your skillset and professional achievements.
Include references and testimonials on your website portfolio. What is the first thing we do when we want to know how good a person or a company is at something? We look for testimonials or reviews from others who have had an experience with that person or company.
